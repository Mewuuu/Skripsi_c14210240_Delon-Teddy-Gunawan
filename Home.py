st.markdown("""
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics.
This dashboard uses two powerful scoring methods:
- **LRFM**: Length, Recency, Frequency, Monetary
- **MLRFM**: Multi-Layer Recency, Frequency, Monetary

And applies three clustering techniques:
-  **K-Means Clustering**
-  **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)**
-  **K-Medoids Clustering**
